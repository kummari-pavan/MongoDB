Find
-----
The find() method is used to retrieve documents from a collection.

There are 2 methods to find and select data from a MongoDB collection, find() and findOne().

find():
-------
To select data from a collection in MongoDB, we can use the find() method.
This method accepts a query object. If left empty, all documents will be returned.

Find All Documents:

>>> db.collection_name.find()

Find with a Query:
------------------
Example: Find all documents where age is greater than 25:

>>> db.collection_name.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } }) 

Find with Specific Fields:
--------------------------
Example: Find only the name and age fields:

>>> db.collection_name.find({}, { name: 1, age: 1, _id: 0 })

Projection
-----------
Both find methods accept a second parameter called projection.

This parameter is an object that describes which fields to include in the results.

Note: This parameter is optional. If omitted, all fields will be included in the results.

Example

This example will only display the title and date fields in the results.
>>> db.posts.find({}, {title: 1, date: 1})
