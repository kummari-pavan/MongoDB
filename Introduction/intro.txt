SQL vs Document Databases:
--------------------------
SQL databases are considered relational databases. They store related data in separate tables. When data is needed, it is queried from 
multiple tables to join the data back together.

MongoDB is a document database which is often referred to as a non-relational database. This does not mean that relational data cannot be 
stored in document databases. It means that relational data is stored differently. A better way to refer to it is as a non-tabular database.

MongoDB stores data in flexible documents. Instead of having multiple tables you can simply keep all of your related data together. This 
makes reading your data very fast.

Local vs Cloud Database:
------------------------
MongoDB can be installed locally, which will allow you to host your own MongoDB server on your hardware. This requires you to manage your 
server, upgrades, and any other maintenance.
